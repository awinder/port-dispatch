Port-Dispatch
============
Reserves a range of free ports on a host, and then provides utilities for retrieving an open port from the pool or releasing a port back to the pool.  For use with Continuous Integration systems where testing networked services concurrently requires spinning them up on unused ports.  Port scanners are nice but two jobs could simultaneously start, read that a port is open, and then spawn services on the same port and clobber eachother.  In CI environments like Bamboo, jobs have no contextual awareness of eachother.  Port Dispatch, on the other hand, will have contextual awareness of what ports are being used, which are free to issue, and crucially, will unblock & issue ports atomically.  CI jobs will need to call into Port Dispatch asking for a port, Port Dispatch will then unblock a port and release it to one, and only one, requester.  When the job is done, it must call back into Port Dispatch to release the port back into the pool.
